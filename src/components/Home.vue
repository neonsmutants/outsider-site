        <br>
        <p>
          In North Side Chicago, in the middle of the 20th century, 
          there was a reclusive hospital janitor who lived in one room – 
          and <strong>who turned out to be an artistic genius</strong>. 
          <strong>Henry Darger invented a whole world inside that room, making 
          hundreds of paintings and collages, and writing fantasy novels 
          that were 15,000 pages long</strong>. His work told the story of an ongoing 
          battle between good and evil, where rampaging armies battled a band 
          of brave children called The Vivian Girls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly a half century after Darger’s death, <strong>Gotan Project’s Philippe 
          Cohen Solal and Tunng’s Mike Lindsay present OUTSIDER</strong>, a tapestry of 
          ten warm and resonant, rapturous pop songs and gorgeous visuals that 
          transmit and translate Darger’s story into the current day.
          <strong>These are heart-soaked instant classics, brought to life in remarkable
          style by singers Adam Glover and Hannah Peel</strong>. These are not your average 
          love songs.

          <strong>HENRY DARGER (1892-1973) was a reclusive hospital janitor and dishwasher who led a secret life as a prolific visual artist and epic novelist</strong>. His vast collection of creative work was discovered in 1972 when his two-room apartment in Chicago was cleared out shortly before he died. Over some 350 watercolor, pencil, collage and carbon-traced drawings, most of them stitched into three enormous "albums," as well as seven typewritten hand-bound books, thousands of bundled sheets of typewritten text, and numerous journals, ledgers and scrapbooks were discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Darger's unpublished 15,000-page typewritten fantasy novel, <strong>The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion</strong> — or, for short, In the Realms of the Unreal — and its 8,500-page handwritten sequel of sorts, Further Adventures of the Vivian Girls in Chicago, were the sagas upon which he based several hundred panoramic "illustrations," many of them double-sided and more than 9 feet in length.
