        <p>« I dream that this transmedia project <strong>brings together past, present and future</strong>. Music, visual arts and storytelling. I would like that through this audiovisual and interactive creation inspired by the work and life of the most famous artist of Art Brut, the public questions <strong>the role and relationship of celebrity to the necessity of art</strong>. » <br><br> - Philippe Cohen Solal</p>

        <p>
          In North Side Chicago, in the middle of the 20th century, 
          there was a reclusive hospital janitor who lived in one room – 
          and <strong>who turned out to be an artistic genius</strong>. 
          <strong>Henry Darger invented a whole world inside that room, making 
          hundreds of paintings and collages, and writing fantasy novels 
          that were 15,000 pages long</strong>. His work told the story of an ongoing 
          battle between good and evil, where rampaging armies battled a band 
          of brave children called The Vivian Girls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearly a half century after Darger’s death, <strong>Gotan Project’s Philippe 
          Cohen Solal and Tunng’s Mike Lindsay present OUTSIDER</strong>, a tapestry of 
          ten warm and resonant, rapturous pop songs and gorgeous visuals that 
          transmit and translate Darger’s story into the current day.
          <strong>These are heart-soaked instant classics, brought to life in remarkable
          style by singers Adam Glover and Hannah Peel</strong>. These are not your average 
          love songs.
